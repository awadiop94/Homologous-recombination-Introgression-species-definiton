# Homologous-recombination-Introgression-species-definiton
This repository contains scripts for inferring introgression between bacterial species using Average nucleotide identity (ANI), phylogenetics and gene flow analysis

## Features
- Ani-based clustering
- Phylogenetic tree building
- Homologous recombination detection and gene flow analysis within and between species

   ## Usage
- Run scripts with Python 3 and R dependencies listed in 'requirements.txt.
